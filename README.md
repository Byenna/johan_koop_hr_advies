# Feel free to collaborate! 

1 Create a Fork
Simply click on the “fork” button of the repository page on GitHub.

2 Clone your Fork
The standard clone command creates a local git repository from your remote fork on GitHub.

3 Type into your terminal:<br>
<i>- git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git</i><br>
<i>- npm install</i><br>

Modify the Code
In your local clone, modify the code and commit them to your local clone using the git commit command.

4 Push your Changes
In your workspace, use the git push command to upload your changes to your remote fork on GitHub.

5 Create a Pull Request
On the GitHub page of your remote fork, click the “pull request” button. Wait for me to merge or comment your changes and be proud when it is merged :). If I suggest some changes before merging, you can simply push these changes into your fork by repeating steps #3 and #4 and the pull request is updated automatically.
